Description
===========
  This cookbook provides libraries, resources and providers to configure and manage Windows Azure components.
  This is a very limited and work in progress version. 
  
  Currently supported resources:

  * VM Disks (`vm_disk`)
  * VM Endpoints (`vm_endpoint`)


Requirements
============
  This cookbook has been tested only with Chef 11.6.0 and is specific for Ubuntu. Cross platform recipes are expected in next versions


Windows Azure credentials
=========================
  In order to manage Windows Azure components, authentication credentials need to be available to the node. 
  The default recipe will install the Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface and most commands require a Windows Azure subscription.

  A data bag called 'azure' with a 'publishsettings' item is required. This item should contain a Windows Azure subscription id,
  a Windows Azure subscription name and the Windows Azure subscription certificate
  
      âžœ  bundle exec knife data bag show azure publishsettings --secret-file .chef/data_bag_key -F json
      {
        "id": "publishsettings",
        "subscription_id": "<AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>",
        "subscription_name": "<AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME>",
        "subscription_certificate": "<AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_CERTIFICATE>"
      }

  **Note:** To obtain the certificate run the command `azure account download` in your local machine. More info at <http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/install-and-configure-cli/>
